                <p class="justin">We are a reliable technology partner specialising in our two flagship services: <a href="#extendedteams" class="page-scroll">extended teams</a>, and <a href="#tandems" class="page-scroll">tandems</a>. We are headquartered in Warsaw, Poland, and are focusing in catering to software development needs of companies based in Sweden, Norway and Denmark.</p>

                <h2>What are Extended Teams?</h2>

                <p class="justin">An extended development team is, as the name suggests, an extension of your core team. There are several characteristics of an extended team that make it an attractive option for your business:</p>

                <p class="justin"><ul class="actions">
                    <li><b>An extended team augments your core team, it does not replace it.</b> The key business and technical competency is still protected, while the extension team is setup to bridge the skill gaps in your core staff.</li>
                    <li><b>You have full control over the project.</b> The constant direct communication between the in-house staff and the extended team developers makes it all function as one unit.</li>
                    <li><b>The responsibilities are distributed among all team members,</b> both core and extended. All of them are equally invested into the project.</li>
                </ul></p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="tandems" class="container content-section text-center">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2">
                <h2>What are Tandems?</h2>

                <p class="justin">Tandems is our innovative modification of the extended team concept. A tandem is a pair of two developers: a junior one, who is participating in your project full time, and a senior one, who is available part time, and is mentoring the junior developer. There are many benefits of this setup:</p>

                <p class="justin"><ul class="actions">
                    <li><b>It's cost effective.</b> Two developers join your team, yet your cost is significantly lower than the cost of two engineers.</li>
                    <li><b>You get to benefit from a senior developer's experience.</b> Available for your project at least one day a week, he or she will provide valuable input to your team's competence and boost its effectiveness, at a fraction of cost.</li>
                    <li><b>The junior developer is mentored by the senior.</b> There is no better way to learn and grow than to be mentored by someone experienced. The junior developer will consult the senior in case of solving complex problems, which otherwise could take a lot of time. Additionally, his or hers competence will be regularly expanded through a series of one-to-one workshops, technically relevant to your business focus.</li>
                    <li><b>The tandem communicates well.</b> Since they cooperate closely on regular basis, and spend time together during the workshops and mentoring, their interactions are more effective. They simply know each other better, and you get a great culture fit, at no cost.</li>
                </ul></p>

                <h2>Why us?</h2>

                <p class="justin">We have have a significant software development experience, and still actively work on projects. Our approach is to get technical as early as possible, in order to save time and avoid misunderstandings. Our immediate area of expertise is mobile and cloud, and we are well connected with the talent in Poland.</p>

                <h4>Polish developers are objectively pretty good.</h4>
                <p class="justin">Not that we are biased, but something about the Polish work culture, and the economy of Poland, makes the developers here offer a sweet spot of tradeoffs:</p>

                <p class="justin"><ul class="actions">
                    <li><b>We are not the cheapest, but still significantly less expensive than your local talent.</b> We are, though, a great value for money: well educated (11th in the world in science and mathematics, according to OECD PISA 2015), ambitious, knowledgeable, and hard working (165 more hours per year than the average of OECD).</li>
                    <li><b>We really like programming.</b> For many years, we've been consistently ranking top in various coding competitions, like HackerRank, and winning challenges like TopCoder, or Google Code Jam.</li>
                    <li><b>We tend to think outside of the box.</b> It used to be hard to live in Poland, and we've got to learn how to deal with limitations and barriers in a smart way. With our can-do attitude, we'll be a valuable asset in your project.</li>
                    <li><b>It's easy to communicate with us.</b> English proficiency is already pretty good, and is getting better. We are 9th in the English Proficiency Index by EF 2015.</li>
                    <li><b>We are accessible.</b> It only takes an inexpensive 90min flight to get from Stockholm or Gothenburg to Warsaw.</li>
                </ul></p>

                <h4>We offer a setup that is the most optimal for you.</h4>
                <p class="justin">We take care of it all, should you require so. We have acquired domain-specific knowledge, and continuous growth is at the core of our philosophy. However, should you wish to keep a close oversight and control over our actions, we will make sure you do. There are many different possible forms of collaboration, and we'll adapt to the one that makes the most sense for your goals. The scale is also up for discussion.</p>

                <h4>Agile + reliable</h4>
                <p class="justin">We do things the modern way, with quick iterations to keep things moving fast. Yet, thanks to our extensive connections with software companies in Poland, we provide you the stability of a big organisation, so you can enjoy the benefits of both worlds.</p>

                <p class="justin">We don’t just take all projects that come across. We want to understand your needs first, so that we can can be sure you are making the right choice, and we are the right partner for you.</p>
